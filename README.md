# Algorithimic Analysis

This is a short assignment completed in ICS4U under Mr. Marco Arsenault, which aims to provide a complete runtime breakdown of sorting/searching algorithms.

## Program Details:

- Generation of object lists and sorting/searching for element in the object list
- Complete runtime breakdown in sheets which analyze the average time it takes to run an algorithm for set amount of objects

# Algorithms:

- Insertion Sort
- Java's Default Sort
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

Timing uses System.nanoTime(); which gives the most accurate timing prespective in nanoSeconds. Converting to milliSeconds can be done after that.

In the excel sheet provided, there are runtimes noted which contain the averages as well.

## There are images of the graphs of average times to objects as well for each algorithm ##

* Plotting these average runtimes to the objects, will give us the time complexity graphs.

The aim of this project is to understand that **do not make your own algorithms, if there is already one defined in the langauge you are working with**.
